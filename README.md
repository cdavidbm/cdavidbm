# Hi, I'm Christian!

I am an enthusiast of Python and creative coding, passionate about exploring the intersections between technology and art. Through programming, I aim to transform abstract ideas into interactive and visual experiences that ignite the imagination. 

I am a programming teacher with a strong interest in art and philosophy. I'm currently exploring algorithmic music composition techniques and generative art.

My background in the arts has given me creativity and ingenuity, skills that I apply across various fields of knowledge, including communication and leadership abilities to manage projects and teams.

As a developer, I have a deep proficiency in Python, specializing in backend and AI development.
